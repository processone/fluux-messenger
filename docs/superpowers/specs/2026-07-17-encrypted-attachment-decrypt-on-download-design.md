# Decrypt encrypted attachments on download

**Date:** 2026-07-17
**Status:** Design — pending review
**Scope:** `apps/fluux` only. No SDK change, no new cryptography.

## Problem

When a peer sends an end-to-end-encrypted file (XEP-0454 media sharing inside a
XEP-0373 "OX" `urn:xmpp:openpgp:0` envelope), Fluux decrypts the message
envelope correctly and the SDK parses the `aesgcm://` reference into a
`FileAttachment`:

- `attachment.url` — a plain HTTPS URL pointing at **AES-GCM ciphertext**
- `attachment.encryption` — `{ cipher: 'aes-256-gcm', key, iv }`

Inline media (image / video / audio) resolves through `useAttachmentUrl`, which
fetches the ciphertext and calls `decryptFile` before rendering — so display
works. But every **download-to-disk** path ignores `attachment.encryption` and
links directly at `attachment.url`, i.e. at ciphertext. Downloading **any**
encrypted attachment — of any type — therefore saves undecryptable bytes.

This is type-agnostic: the fix keys solely on `attachment.encryption` being
present, never on MIME type or filename. It must work for every attachment kind
(images, video, audio, PDFs, documents, archives, and any other file), not just
PDFs. PDF is merely the reported example.

Observed live: a PDF from `edaveine@process-one.net` (Fluux desktop) — the OX
message decrypts, but the file card's download link yields ciphertext.

### The three broken paths

All in `apps/fluux/src/components/`:

1. **`FileAttachments.tsx` → `FileAttachmentCard`** (PDFs, documents, archives):
   `<a href={attachment.url} target="_blank">`. *Primary bug.*
2. **`FileAttachments.tsx` → video and audio** info-bar + error-fallback download
   links: `<a href={attachment.url} download>`.
3. **`FileAttachments.tsx` → image error-fallback** link: `<a href={attachment.url}>`.

`ImageLightbox.tsx`'s download button is already correct — it saves the
already-decrypted blob (`proxiedSrc`). It is the model this design generalizes.

## Non-goals

- **No inline preview** of encrypted non-media files. This change decrypts and
  saves to disk only. Inline PDF preview is a separate future feature.
- **No new crypto / no SDK change.** The file is AES-GCM (XEP-0454); the key/IV
  are already parsed into `attachment.encryption`. Detection is simply
  "`attachment.encryption` is present" — the explicit on-the-wire signal, no
  MIME/filename heuristics.
- **No eager decryption.** Encrypted file cards must not fetch+decrypt on render
  (large files, media-autoload deferral). Decryption happens on click.

## Design

### 1. Shared helper: `downloadAttachment`

Add to `apps/fluux/src/utils/download.ts`:

```
export async function downloadAttachment(
  attachment: Pick<FileAttachment, 'url' | 'name' | 'encryption'>,
  options?: { errorMessage?: string },
): Promise<void>
```

Behavior:

- **No `attachment.encryption`** → delegate to the existing
  `downloadFile(attachment.url, name, options)`. Unchanged behavior.
- **Has `attachment.encryption`** → resolve the *decrypted* content URL using the
  same cached resolver the inline renderers use:
  - Tauri: `resolveEncryptedMediaUrl(url, encryption)` → `asset://…/{sha256}.dec`
  - Web: `resolveWebEncryptedMediaUrl(url, encryption)` → `blob:` URL
  Then call `downloadFile(decryptedUrl, name, options)`.

Reuse points:
- The resolvers already dedupe in-flight requests and cache decrypted output, so
  a file previously viewed inline downloads instantly (cache hit), and a
  download-then-view is a hit too.
- `downloadFile` already handles the platform save mechanics (native save dialog
  + `writeFile` on Tauri via `fetch(assetUrl)`; `<a download>` on web with a
  same-origin blob URL, so the filename is honored) and already surfaces a
  localized error toast on failure.
- A decrypt/fetch failure inside the resolver (AEAD auth-tag mismatch, 404, etc.)
  propagates; `downloadAttachment` catches it and emits the same error toast as
  `downloadFile`, so tampered/broken ciphertext never silently writes a file.

`name` falls back to a sensible default (`attachment.name ?? 'download'`).

### 2. `FileAttachmentCard` — decrypt-aware

- **Plaintext (`!encryption`)**: keep the current `<a href target="_blank">` so
  in-browser preview of plain PDFs still works. No change.
- **Encrypted**: render a `<button>` that calls `downloadAttachment(attachment)`
  with a small in-progress state (spinner on the download glyph, disabled while
  resolving) so a multi-megabyte decrypt gives feedback. On success the file is
  saved; on failure the shared error toast fires.

The card keeps its existing visual layout (icon, name, type/size, download
glyph); only the click target and its element type differ by branch.

### 3. Video / audio / image download buttons

Replace the ciphertext `<a href={attachment.url} …>` download controls in the
video info-bar, audio info-bar, and the video/audio/image error-fallback states
with a control that calls `downloadAttachment(attachment, { errorMessage })`.
For the success info-bar states the decrypted bytes are already cached from
playback, so the download is instant; for error states the helper still attempts
a fresh fetch+decrypt and toasts on failure.

## Data flow (encrypted download)

```
click download
  → downloadAttachment(attachment)
    → resolve*EncryptedMediaUrl(attachment.url, attachment.encryption)   // cached
        → (miss) fetch ciphertext → decryptFile(bytes, key, iv)          // AEAD-verified
        → write plaintext to platform cache → return asset://|blob: URL
    → downloadFile(decryptedUrl, attachment.name)
        → Tauri: save dialog → fetch(decryptedUrl) → writeFile
        → Web:  <a download="name" href="blob:…">
```

## Testing

- **Unit (`download.test.ts`)**: extend to cover `downloadAttachment`.
  - No-encryption → calls `downloadFile` with the raw URL (delegation).
  - With-encryption → resolves via the (mocked) encrypted resolver, then calls
    `downloadFile` with the decrypted URL, never the ciphertext URL.
  - Resolver rejection → error toast, no `writeFile`/anchor with ciphertext.
  - Platform branch (Tauri vs web) picks the matching resolver.
- **Component**: `FileAttachmentCard` renders a plain `<a>` for a plaintext
  attachment and a decrypt button for an encrypted one; clicking the button
  invokes `downloadAttachment`.
- Existing `messageStyles.aesgcm.test.tsx` / `mediaCache.test.ts` continue to
  pass (resolvers untouched).

## Files touched

- `apps/fluux/src/utils/download.ts` — add `downloadAttachment`.
- `apps/fluux/src/utils/download.test.ts` — add coverage.
- `apps/fluux/src/components/FileAttachments.tsx` — file card + media download
  controls become decrypt-aware.
- Possibly `apps/fluux/src/components/ImageLightbox.tsx` — only if consolidating
  its already-correct download onto the shared helper (optional, cosmetic).

No new i18n keys required beyond the existing `common.downloadFailed` /
`common.download`.
